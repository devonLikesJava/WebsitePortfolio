            <p>This is a CAD model of a feet holder that I created for the chairs in my kitchen. The problem was that the feet were made out of metal whcih would scratch up our wooden floors so I made little feet for the chairs out of PLA filament that way it would scratch the floor it worked greatly as the feet had enough grip they would stay on even when lifting the chairs.</p>
